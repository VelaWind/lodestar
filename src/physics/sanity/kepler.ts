/**
 * Cross-validates the Kepler orbit model.
 *
 * Kept out of the five-check count above for the same reason as the escape
 * integrator: that list is the skill's, this is ours. Three checks, each aimed
 * at a different way this code could be wrong.
 *
 *   1. Earth's period, through the *new* module's code path. This duplicates
 *      check 1 above deliberately — the point is that `period()` and the sim
 *      that calls it reproduce the same 365.25 days the constants do, so a unit
 *      slip inside `kepler.ts` cannot hide behind a check that never touches it.
 *   2. Kepler's second law, numerically. Specific angular momentum r²·dν/dt must
 *      be constant around the orbit and equal to the closed form √(GM·a(1−e²)).
 *      Sampled at e = 0.97 — the eccentricity slider's maximum, so the check
 *      covers the whole range a reader can actually reach. Speed there varies by
 *      a factor of sixty-six between the apsides and a broken anomaly conversion
 *      has nowhere to hide. dν/dt is a central difference over T/10⁶, small
 *      enough that truncation error is ~10⁻⁷ and large enough that cancellation
 *      is ~10⁻¹².
 *   3. Vis-viva against angular momentum at the apsides. At periapsis and
 *      apoapsis, and nowhere else, velocity is perpendicular to the radius, so
 *      v·r there is exactly h. Two independent formulas — one from energy, one
 *      from angular momentum — that must agree.
